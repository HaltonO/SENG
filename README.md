# Intro

**Interaction design:** design interactive products to support people in their everyday life. i.e. improve their understanding of what can be done, what happended and what's happening. it is like software engineering in the same way architecture related to civil engineering.

**For Interaction Design to succeed,** many disciplines are invloved e.g. psychologists, sociologist, doctors, educators ... etc
In the past computers were designed only for CS & engineers but nowadays all these disciplines are involved.

**HCI:** short for Human Computer interaction which is the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use. 

**Notes**

1- Designing a product depends on the understanding of many aspects. e.g. designing a story kit for kids depends on how kids read and write stores and how they percieve things.

2- working with many people from different disciplines means confusion and misunderstanding because each has their own perspective of the world.

3- Interaction design can either bring a business up or can drag it down.

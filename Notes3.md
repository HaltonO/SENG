**Why does software fail:**

5- Unfriendly to use. 6- Confusing.
7- Ignorance about real users.

**Software Development Nowadays:**

Managers initiate an idea and command desingers to design a project.
Designers send specifications to developers and developers send back feedback to designers.
Developers submit code to testers/QA and testers report back any bugs.

**ACD (Activity centered design):**

Focuses on activites users do rather than on goals. this way designers can notice missing tasks as they may frequently change whereas goals usually stay the same.

**GDD (Goal directed design):**

Focuses on goals. puts users at heart of design process and understanding of their needs and goals.

**Some Questions designers should ask:**

1- Who are the users?
2- How are they going to use it?
3- What is their goal?
4- How do they feel about it?
